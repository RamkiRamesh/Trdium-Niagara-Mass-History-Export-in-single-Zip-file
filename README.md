# Tridium-Niagara-Scripts
Useful Java scripts for Tridium Niagara N4
This particular code i did'nt work from scrath.
i recieved this code from collegue friend.
the actual code will be execute to export all (we can add unwnated histories on exclude list) the histories from Niagara Station under the files in single folder.
in this method End user have to download the exported CSV files by clicking one by one fro browser (consider end user dont have Workbench only option he can connect to Niagara station from browser).
and its time taking task for client.
other way we can provide series transfrom ,but all cases no need series transform, and also setting up series transform or modfication in that also time taking process.
so i was thinking to modify the script to do extra task that once its finish the exposrting in a folder , it will create zip file of that folder.
once we generate the zip file , we can give single click button on any .px page ,
so in this way user can execute the code and dowload the entire history file as a single zip file without spending mode time.
Feel free to contact me for any furthur support or clarification.
